# scotty - AI Health Coach MVP 
- Conversational AI coaching for training, nutrition & habits. 
- Context-aware recommendations powered by GPT.
- Built as an experimental MVP to explore scalable digital coaching.

## Overview
Scotty is an experimental AI-powered health coach designed to explore how conversational AI can deliver lightweight, personalized guidance for everyday training, nutrition and habit building.
The project was built as a fast MVP to test whether AI-driven coaching can reduce the friction of traditional personal coaching models.

## Problem
Traditional health coaching is often expensive, rigid and difficult to integrate into everyday life. At the same time, many digital health solutions rely on wearables or intensive tracking, creating additional cost and adoption barriers, even though many people want to live healthier lives.

The goal of Scotty was to explore:
- How AI can provide contextual support without complex tracking
- How conversational interfaces can increase engagement
- How lightweight digital coaching can scale

## Solution
Scotty combines a conversational UX with AI-generated recommendations to provide:
- Personalized coaching conversations
- Context-aware responses based on chat history
- Guidance on training, nutrition and routines
- Low-friction interaction without heavy setup

## Vision
To explore a new generation of digital coaching: AI-driven, conversational and highly accessible - designed to support healthier lifestyles through lightweight interaction rather than heavy tracking or complex systems.

## Tech Stack

**Frontend**
- Adalo (No-code mobile app UI)

**Backend**
- Xano (Database, logic and API layer)

**AI Layer**
- OpenAI GPT API

**Architecture**
- API-driven no-code setup enabling fast experimentation

## Key Features
- Conversational AI coaching
- Context-aware chat experience
- Personalized recommendations
- Lightweight onboarding & interaction
- Modular API-based setup

## My Role
- Product vision & concept development
- AI use case design
- UX and interaction logic
- Architecture design (no-code + API stack)
- MVP execution & testing

## Learnings
- Context continuity matters more than model complexity
- UX friction reduces engagement faster than missing features
- No-code + API architecture enables rapid AI experimentation
- Conversational interfaces create high perceived personalization
- Deeper health and behavioral data is still required to generate highly personalized, high-quality recommendations
  
## Why this project matters
Scotty explores how conversational AI can replace high-friction personal coaching models through lightweight, scalable digital interaction design.

## Project Status
Archived MVP. Built to explore AI-based digital coaching concepts and validate product assumptions.
